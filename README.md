#### [A Day in the Life NYC Taxi Data Set](https://chriswhong.github.io/nyctaxi/) This data set created by Chris Wong tracked the movement of a taxi in NYC for 24hrs. This data set collected information such as total revenue, trip start and end points, if the taxi was full or empty, tips given, tolls taken, and the taxiâ€™s exact location in real time. This data set can be extremely useful to the stakeholders of the taxi company as it tracks the production of its employees (taxi drivers) in real time. The application of this data can produce trends of the most profitable routes and areas to deploy and employ their taxis ultimately earning the company more revenue. For example, managers can compare the profitability of taking a route that avoids tolls vs. one that may be quicker but incurs a toll fee. Similarly, stakeholders can see which areas produce more tips and has more personnel that need rides.
#### [Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom by Yochai Benkler](http://www.benkler.org/Benkler_Wealth_Of_Networks.pdf) This book interests me because it explores how information and knowledge affect human behavior and, conversely, how human behavior is used as data points that influence information and knowledge. I am intrigued by the observation and prediction of human behavior for a specific goal and I am interested to learn how this book unveils that theme.
